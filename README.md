solar_system_model.py is a program I wrote for a uni assignment with which I received a grade of 99%. The question was as follows:

  Implement the forward Euler method, using the difference equations above, to model the orbits of the four closest planets to the Sun.  Here we are assuming that     each planet only feels the Sun's gravitational pull (and not that of the other planets) and that motion is confined to the xy-plane.

I decided to make use of object oriented programming in order to simplify my code and reduce its length by almost half. This was a great learning experience as I had never used objects before and to achieve an almost perfect score was extremely satisfying.
